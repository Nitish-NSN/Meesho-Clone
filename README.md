# Meesho-Clone
This project is a frontend-only clone of Meesho, the popular Indian e-commerce platform, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
It replicates the look and feel of Meeshoâ€™s website, focusing on creating a clean, responsive, and user-friendly interface.
The clone includes a homepage with banners and category sections, a product listing grid with price and discount details, and basic navigation elements. 
The design is fully responsive, making it suitable for both desktop and mobile screens.
While this clone does not include backend functionality such as authentication, real-time data, or payment integration, it serves as a strong demonstration of front-end development skills, UI layout design, and e-commerce interface architecture
